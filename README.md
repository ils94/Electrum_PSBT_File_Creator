Electrum for Android doesnâ€™t provide an option to save your PSBT as a file; it only allows you to copy or share it via an intent. This app serves as an extension, enabling users to quickly generate a PSBT file and save it directly to their device, SD card, connected USB drive, or send it via Bluetooth.

With this, you can easily transfer your PSBT to your Cold Wallet for signing.
